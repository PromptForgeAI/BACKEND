# PromptForge Academy: Backend API & Frontend Integration Guide

## 1. Backend Endpoints for Academy Content

The backend exposes REST endpoints under `/api/academy` to serve all Academy modules and interactive features:

### Content & Curriculum
- **GET `/api/academy/curriculum`**
  - Returns the curriculum structure (modules, lessons)
  - Reads from `public/curriculum.json` or `content/curriculum.json`
- **GET `/api/academy/lesson/{lesson_id}`**
  - Returns lesson metadata and content from `content/academy/{lesson_id}.json`

### Interactive Features
- **POST `/api/academy/labs/run`**
  - Proxies prompt/lab runs to backend (rate-limited for guests)
- **POST `/api/academy/progress`**
  - Stores user progress (userId, lessonId, completedParts, xp, timestamp)
- **POST `/api/academy/quest/submit`**
  - Handles quest/task submissions and auto-evaluation
- **GET `/api/academy/leaderboard`**
  - Returns leaderboard data (top XP)
- **POST `/api/academy/validate`** (admin-only)
  - Validates MDX files in `content/academy`

**All content modules in `content/academy/` are accessible via these endpoints.**

## 2. Frontend UI/UX Brainstorm

### Recommended User Experience
- **Curriculum Page:**
  - Sidebar or grid of modules (from `/api/academy/curriculum`)
  - Each module expands to show lessons
- **Lesson Page:**
  - Fetches lesson data from `/api/academy/lesson/{lesson_id}`
  - Renders lesson content (HTML/MDX), metadata, and interactive elements (quizzes, labs)
  - "Mark as complete" button (calls `/api/academy/progress`)
  - "Run Lab" button (calls `/api/academy/labs/run` for code/AI tasks)
- **Progress Tracking:**
  - Progress bar or checklist for completed lessons/modules
  - XP/points and leaderboard (from `/api/academy/leaderboard`)
- **Quests/Tasks:**
  - Submission forms for quests (calls `/api/academy/quest/submit`)
  - Auto-evaluation feedback

### Frontend Stack Options
- **React (Next.js, Vite, etc.):**
  - Dynamic routing for modules/lessons
  - Fetches data from the above endpoints
- **Docusaurus:**
  - Great for static content, documentation, and MDX-based lessons
  - For dynamic features (progress, labs, quests), extend with custom React components and API calls
  - For a full-featured interactive academy, consider a hybrid approach or a custom React app

#### Feature Table
| Feature         | Docusaurus | Custom React App |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Static lessons  | ✅         | ✅              |
| Curriculum nav  | ✅         | ✅              |
| Progress/XP     | ⚠️ (custom)| ✅              |
| Labs/quizzes    | ⚠️ (custom)| ✅              |
| Leaderboard     | ⚠️ (custom)| ✅              |

## 3. Docusaurus: Can It Be Used?
- **Yes, for static curriculum/lesson content.**
- For interactive features (progress, labs, quests), you must add custom React components and API integrations.
- Docusaurus is ideal for documentation-style UI, but for a full interactive academy, a custom React app or hybrid is more flexible.

---

## 4. Integration Summary & Next Steps
- Use `/api/academy/curriculum` and `/api/academy/lesson/{lesson_id}` to drive the frontend.
- For a pure doc-style site, Docusaurus is fine. For a full interactive academy, consider a custom React app or hybrid.
- All backend endpoints are ready to serve content and interactive features on demand.
